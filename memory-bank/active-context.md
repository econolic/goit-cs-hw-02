## Current Session Notes

- [20:16:37] [Unknown User] Cleaned up project structure: Removed unnecessary files and updated README.md:

- Removed TASK1_README.md (redundant documentation)
- Removed check_websites.sh (extended version, keeping only main script)
- Updated README.md to include proper project documentation with:
  - Project description
  - Task 1 information
  - Usage instructions for WSL and Git Bash
  - Script features and example output

Current project structure:
- README.md (updated with full documentation)
- website_checker.sh (main script)
- website_status.log (generated output)
- memory-bank/ (project memory)

The project is now clean and focused with only necessary files.
- [20:05:59] [Unknown User] Completed Task 1 - Website availability checker: Successfully created Bash scripts to check website availability:

1. **website_checker.sh** - Main script that meets all requirements:
   - Written in Bash with proper shebang
   - Uses array of websites (google.com, facebook.com, twitter.com)
   - Uses curl with -L flag to handle redirects
   - Loops through all websites in array
   - Checks for HTTP status code 200
   - Writes results to website_status.log in format "<URL> is UP/DOWN"
   - Displays completion message

2. **check_websites.sh** - Extended version with additional console output
   - All features of main script plus:
   - Real-time progress display
   - Timestamp in log file
   - Visual indicators (✓/✗)
   - Shows log file contents after completion

3. **TASK1_README.md** - Documentation explaining usage in WSL and Git Bash

Both scripts tested successfully and generate proper log file output. All acceptance criteria met:
✅ Written in Bash
✅ Handles redirects (curl -L)
✅ Uses loop for website iteration  
✅ Uses curl for HTTP requests
✅ Logs results to file with completion message
✅ Clean, formatted code
